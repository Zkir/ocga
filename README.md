# OCGA
osm-cga, or Computer Generated Architecture for OSM

## Our Goal
The real holy grail of neocarthogaphy is to automatically generate photorealistic models of buildings to show on a map or to use in 3d applications and computer games such as flight simulators(e.g. X-plane). This goal remains as unattainable today as it was 20 years ago. 

In this project, we will do something a bit more easy.  We will create a simple computer language to describe 3D buildings that will allow us to quickly and easily create 3D building models for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) based on the [Simple 3D Buildings](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_3D_Buildings) standard.

This project is largely inspired by ESRI City Engine. However, many things are quite different.
